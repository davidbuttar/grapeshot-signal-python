Introduction
============

This SDK is a python wrapper for Graphshot's signal API. The API can be used
without this wrapper. Wrappers for other some other languages are available or
in development.

Use of the API requires an API key, which can be obtained by creating an
account at the `Developer Portal`_.  The API is self-documenting through a
`swagger specification`_, and the developer portal `documentation pages`_
contain more information.
